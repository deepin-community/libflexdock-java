Building Flexdock
--------------------------

To build this project, obtain a copy of Apache's Ant from
http://ant.apache.org. You must use version 1.6.0 or later.

From this directory you should be able to build everything by running
the command:

  ant dist

This will generate output in the following directories:

  build/bin       The compiled framework and required resource files.
  build/bin-demo  The compiled demos and required resource files.
  build/bin-test  The compiled tests and required resource files
  build/docs      The PDF documentation
  build/docs/api  The framework javadocs
  build/dist      Contains:
                   - a jar containing just the framework code and
                     it's resources
                   - a zip containing this jar, the license file,
                     plus the PDF docs and the javadoc (i.e. a binary
                     distribution of the framework)


If you just want to build the build/binxxx dirs, you can run just: ant

To do this plus build the jar: ant jar

If you want to build a jar without any native code in it, run:

  ant jar -Dgeneric.jar=T

The generated jar will have a -generic.jar suffix.

To clean up everything built by ant, delete the build dir or run: ant clean



Running The Demos via Ant
--------------------------

There are several ant targets for running the demo applications:

  demo         <-- this one is a generic launcher for all the others
  demo.adapter
  demo.border
  demo.compound
  demo.elegant
  demo.jmf
  demo.perspective
  demo.simple
  demo.splitpane
  demo.tabbedpane
  demo.view

To run a demo, choose the name of the demo target you wish to run
and execute it via ant.  For example,

  ant demo

will run the generic demo launcher and

  ant demo.simple

will run the simple demo.
